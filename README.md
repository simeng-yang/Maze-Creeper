# Maze-Creeper
A Maze can be defined in a file using X characters to represent walls, space characters to represent paths, and a $ character to represent the goal. 
The starting point is assumed to be location (1, 1) and the maze is assumed to have a border (walls).
For a maze loaded from an external text-file, this program will show the sequence of positions to reach the goal or, if there is no solution, will indicate that no path is available.
Additionally, this program has the option for the user to show the solve-state of the maze over time, with various speeds, as the program recursively searches through adjacent positions until it meets a terminating condition.
